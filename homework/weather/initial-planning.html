                <br/>John always likes to look his best and is always concerned what the weather forecast will be for that day. He wants to make sure that he dresses properly each day for the weather. Each morning when he is getting ready he looks at the weather to know what type of clothing he should wear that day and if he needs to prepare for rain or other types of weather. In the morning, he is always running behind before he heads off to work, so he uses his smartphone to look up the weather. John wants an easy way to quickly see that days forecast without seeing a lot of other information that he does not care about.

            <h2>Peer Review</h2>
            <p>My work was peer reviewed by Eric Keller. He liked my phone wireframe his only comment is that the ad for the horizontal view was large. I agree it is large and I did it on purpose. I am a business major, and this site like all sites needs to make money. But in reality it will be slightly smaller ads come in specific sizes. He sujested that for the tablet wireframe I line up the detailed weather with weather now. I made that change and included another ad in the space above it. He thought the desktop site was fine. I liked my use of whitespace and use of boxes.</p>
            <p>Exact quote of review: "The android phone portrait has a good layout. It looks good to me. But the only thing is the ads section on the landscape version. It looks too big and distracting. I would suggest putting it a different location and making it smaller. On the tablet layout I would only change the layout of where the detailed weather is located. It looks a little off being to the right and up of the “Weather Now” box. Besides that, it looks good. I do like the use of white space and the buffer you have between boxes. The desktop layout looks great to me. I don’t see anything that I would change."</p>
