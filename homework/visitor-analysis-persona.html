                <h2>Visitor Analysis</h2>
                <p>The demographics for The Verge are mostly young men who are interested in technology. They are probably between teen and mid-thirties year old. Most of the visitors are probably students or currently work in the tech industry. The audience is interested in computers and most likely lives in a wealthier area, or probably not farming area.</p>
                <p>The site is very easy to use and is very clear. The homepage has general stories in many topics. The top right corner has all the new articles listed and the top left corner brings you to a list of topics. If you click on a topic it will pull up articles and stories just about that topic. The site is clear and easy to navigate. It made the mobile experience enjoyable because things were hidden if they were not needed and they only included one story per row. This allows each story block to be large and fill the width of the phone. If they had tried to put two or three stories on each row it would have been harder to read.</p>
                <p>This site looks like it was custom made for mobile experience and specifically my phone. It looks neat and clean. It automatically adjusted on different size screens as well. </p>

                <h2>Real Clear Politics</h2>
                <p>URL: realclearpolitics.com</p>
                <p>Did they or did they not know who their target audience was? Yes they knew who their target audience is, people who follow the news and politics.
                    <br>Did they or did they not meet the needs of their audience? They meet the needs, but not in a very pretty way. It is very rough around the edges. A functional site, but not very pretty.
                    <br>Did they or did they not organize content to facilitate it being found? Some of the content is organized, but no too easy to find yourself around.
                    <br>Did the site facilitate visitors in a mobile environment? It is better than being in a desktop website, but it is not a very good mobile site. It is almost entirely text with only ads as pictures. The alignment is also weird.</p>
