                <h1>About Us</h1>
                    <p>Debt Fix is a great company, even if it is 100% made up. This is for a final project for CIT 230 Web Development. But if this was a real company that it would be awesome, and this part would have some great information about it. It may even include a nice picture of our founder. That has been included below. But it is really just a picture of me!</p>
